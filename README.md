# The challenge
This was a very difficult thing to do. Definitely the most involved thing I coded yet, but I'm super proud that I pulled through.

This is project is a very simple Asteroids implementation using pygame.

# Credits
Once again, thanks for [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) for making this guided project, and figuring out most of the hard math for me.

# Other
If you want to try it out (for some reason), ensure you have the latest python interpreter, and specifically have pygame 2.6.1 installed.
There's a requirements.txt that you can install it from using pip:
```
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
